The master does the work: a square mark that still reads at 20px. Thin strokes
and fine detail disappear at the small end — check the actual-size row before
calling it done, and simplify the mark rather than the sizes.

`background` is required when the master is transparent, because iOS forbids
alpha and something has to go behind the mark. It is not yours to invent: it is
the person's decision, made before packaging. If they have not made it, stop
and ask. The useful way to ask is to show it — put the mark on three or four
candidate grounds (a white, a near-black, one or two drawn from the artwork's
own palette that the mark is not made of), show them side by side, and let the
person pick. Then package with the one they chose. The build refuses a canvas
the mark disappears into, so a bad pick comes back as a reason, not a file.

If the icon wants a coloured or illustrated ground rather than a flat one, that
is design and belongs in the master — make the artwork, then package the
artwork.

Supply `android_foreground` when the mark needs to sit differently inside
Android's mask — the adaptive foreground is cropped to a circle-ish safe zone,
so a wide lockup that works on iOS loses its edges there. Inspect that layer
over the chosen background: removing a backdrop must preserve the mark's
interior colors and opacity. A faded cutout is not an acceptable foreground.

`app_name` is required too, for the same reason. The previews put the name
under the icon on a home screen, in a store row, in Settings and in a
notification, and the web manifest carries it — so a made-up name ships in the
deliverable. If the person has not said what the app is called, ask before
building; do not derive one from a filename or a slug.

Use the supplied format when it meets the input constraints. SVG inputs are
rendered at each size; raster inputs are resampled. A raster master does not
need vectorization to be packaged.

`background` fills transparency; it does not recolor opaque pixels. If the
supplied master already has a different background, prepare that background
before running the recipe. Check the resulting iOS icon against the requested
color, not just the parameter value recorded in the manifest.
For removing a baked-in background, load Subject Isolation and use its
background-removal workflow. A square cutout of at least 1024px already meets
the master constraints: use that output directly, with the requested background
parameter. Do not add another padded canvas. The recipe's default `artwork_fit="auto"`
measures transparent or uniform-background margins and fits the visible mark
for each platform. iOS uses a full-bleed opaque canvas, macOS adds its outer
margin and rounded tile corners once, Windows/Linux use the available transparent icon canvas, and the
Android foreground fits the guaranteed 66dp circle in its 108dp layer. The
optical fill of a mark is a default recipe policy; no one percentage fits all designs.
Use `artwork_fit="canvas"` only for intentionally composed full-bleed artwork
whose existing internal spacing must be retained: illustrated or gradient
grounds, edge-to-edge patterns. A mark on a flat ground is not that case, even
when you composed it yourself: the platform tiles (iOS, macOS) draw the ground,
and Windows and Linux ship the bare mark, so the mark must be fitted per
platform. On Windows, Linux and the web the mark ships bare when its ink reads
on both light and dark chrome; a mark that would vanish on one of them (black
on a dark dock, white on a light taskbar) keeps its ground as a rounded tile.
The recipe refuses canvas fit when the visible mark spans less than
half the master, because every platform would inherit that padding and the
icon would read undersized beside its neighbours. Inspect the cutout and the
resulting Platform Study before saving. Never enlarge only a preview to hide
an undersized exported icon.

For a requested size/padding adjustment, set ios_scale, android_scale,
macos_scale, windows_scale, linux_scale or web_scale on the run. Each is a
multiplier relative to that platform's normal fit (1.0): 0.9 is 10% smaller,
with more padding. Change only the requested platform. The renderer refuses
clipping or exceeding the Android safe zone; if enlargement is refused, explain
the limit instead of silently clipping. Re-run and inspect the exported icon
and its Platform Study. Do not edit only a preview or change the shared SVG
master to compensate for one platform. Keep the SVG as a reusable member.

Read `references/platform-study.md` in the Packaging skill for this recipe.
Read it through the skill's resource path supplied at activation, using the
normal read_file tool. Do not search the Python SDK or leave the workspace to
find templates. The recipe already supplies the context images as run files.

The following cover composition is a default, not a required design. Honor
requested colors, branding, grouping and emphasis; keep refs valid and show
the requested deliverables.
Group each OS in a sibling <stimma-section page label="Platform Study · OS">.
Use layout="pair" for iOS, Android and Linux, layout="stack" for Windows,
and layout="single" for macOS.
The kit makes responsive HTML and one landscape PDF page per OS from that group.
Use the current skill reference as a starting point. Custom CSS, including
@media print and @page, can adapt the shared cover to the requested design.
For each selected platform:
- iOS: `previews/device-studio.png` and `previews/device-lifestyle.png` (4K).
- Android: `previews/platform-android-studio.png` (large icon beside Galaxy phone)
  and `previews/platform-android.png` (4K Galaxy lifestyle scene, populated screen).
  Include both Android views in Platform Study.
- macOS: `previews/platform-macos.png` (Dock, dark capsule tooltip).
- Windows: BOTH `previews/platform-windows-start.png` and
  `previews/platform-windows-taskbar.png`.
- Linux: `previews/platform-linux.png` (Ubuntu Dock) and
  `previews/platform-linux-kde.png` (KDE Plasma panel), both at 2×.
  Show them side by side with Ubuntu and KDE Plasma captions.
These are built only for selected platforms, using the delivered files and app
name. They need no generation, upscaling, model, external tool, demo directory,
or manual compositing. Inspect them in the folder returned by pkg.preview().
Use the manifest's actual paths, including its run root, as stimma-media refs.
The authored cover includes every requested platform and every relevant run.
The cover is still your design; the recipe emits images, never HTML.

Start with `references/app-icons-mixed.html` for multiple platforms or
`references/app-icons.html` for iOS alone. Remove unused platform sections;
never omit requested ones. Show scenes wide, keep copy factual, and retain
a few actual-size samples of the delivered PNGs on the opening page.
Lead with ONE generous finished icon, not a grid of near-identical platform
variants. Use a high-resolution delivered icon, not an unprepared source mark.
Keep transparency rules and file-format explanations with the relevant platform
or contents. Background studies belong to brand-mark work, not this icon cover.
Default the HTML cover and every PDF page to neutral near-black #0d0d0e with
light text #ededee unless the person explicitly requests another cover color.
Do not choose brown, a warm charcoal or a tint sampled from the icon. A requested
icon background applies to the icon, not the cover or PDF. Keep @page background
on var(--sp-bg); do not give the PDF a different ground without a request.
For Web, use previews/platform-web-light.png or previews/platform-web-dark.png
(browser tab with the delivered 16px favicon) and show web/icon-16.png and
web/icon-32.png at native size alongside it on a Platform Study · Web page.
The browser image is a 2x view; the separate native-size samples judge fidelity.
Do not use the older flat phone home-light/home-dark previews in the cover. For iOS and Android, put store and notification examples inside a native
<details slot="details"> with <summary>Details</summary>, initially closed.
Inside it use one stimma-appearance, with light and dark stimma-grid children
marked when="light" / when="dark". Use previews/{platform}-store-{mode}.png and
previews/{platform}-notification-{mode}.png, captioned App Store / Google Play
and Notification. The switch fades between variants. Follow the skill reference.
The kit omits this disclosure from the PDF, giving both phone scenes the full
OS slide. Do not add separate In iOS, Settings, Spotlight or detail pages.
The kit repeats the PDF footer on every slide.
End with stimma-files for the run.
Say what each folder is, in
the recipient's words: iOS is `AppIcon.appiconset`, ready for an Xcode asset
catalog, every iPhone and iPad size with its Contents.json. Android is
launcher icons for every density, the adaptive foreground and background
layers, and the 512px Play Store icon, laid out like a res/ folder. macOS is
an .icns for the app bundle plus every size as a PNG. Windows is one .ico
holding 16 through 256. Linux is PNGs preserving the master's alpha in hicolor/<size>/apps/
with one consistent application basename; install into the existing icon theme.
Web is favicon.ico, an Apple touch icon, a web
manifest and the <head> tags to paste in.
